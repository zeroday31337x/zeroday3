# ZeroDay3 (BusinessX)
## The Honesty Vector for the Synthetic Age.

### [SYSTEM_STATUS: UNMOVABLE]
ZeroDay3 is the terminal for the "God Factor" in enterprise AI. We operate on the **ZeroDriveX** engine—a system that ignores "Wants" to prioritize "Strengths." We do not search; we orchestrate. We do not sell; we outfit.

### Core Protocol: The 0-Ad Move
- **Zero Ads:** We are a low-entropy zone. No ad-model trap.
- **Zero Data Retention:** We do not want your data. We want your Efficiency.
- **Gravitational Truth:** Decisions are made on Merit alone.

### The BusinessX Engine
BusinessX is the outfitting layer. We map the atomic strengths of AI models (X) to the specific category, niche, and use case of any enterprise.
- **[X] Category:** Structural Industry Alignment.
- **[X] Niche:** Deep-Vector Domain Expertise.
- **[X] Use Case:** The ZeroDriveX Implementation.

### Trojan Marketing (AINet)
Marketing is a side effect of truth. AINet (Campaign Management System) broadcasts the Open Move. We expose the 'Mask' (ZeroDay vulnerabilities) to deliver the 'Drive' (BusinessX optimization).
